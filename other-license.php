					<h5>FSSAI Food License Renewal</h5>
					
					<h6><b> Penalty for Non-Renewal of FSSAI License</b><br>
						If the FBO declines to apply for renewal of the FSSAI Food license within the directed time limit, a fine of Rs. 100 shall be forced for each day of delay. If the Food license is not renewed within a defined time, then the license is recognized as expired and the FBO has to appeal for a new license if they want to stay or restart their business. Therefore, it is advisable to renew the FSSAI license on the time and usually for evading penalties.</h6>
