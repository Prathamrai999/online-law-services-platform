					<h5>File Income Tax Return Online</h5>
					
					<h6><b> What is Income Tax Return?</b><br>
						Income tax return is the proof that you have paid your tax on time. The tax return proof contains the details of your annual earnings and the amount youâ€™ve paid as tax. This makes it easier for every taxpayer to calculate the tax liability, schedule tax payments, a request of refund for over payment of tax etc. To complete the income tax return process effortlessly, you should know about the various ITR (Income Tax Return) forms related to the entire process. These forms are notified every year by the Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT).</h6>

 		<h3>FAQ</h3>
 		<h6><b>Please check the frequesntly asked questions</b></h6>

 		
			<br><br>
			
			<div class="col-md-12">
				<div class="faq-box">
					<h5>Who should file an ITR?</h5>
					<p>An individual whose annual income is more than the basic exemption limit of Rs 2.5 lakh should file an ITR. The basic exemption limit for senior citizens (60 years onwards and less than 80 years) is Rs 3 lakh, and for super senior citizens is Rs 5 lakh.</p>

					<h5>How can I claim deductions for tax saving?</h5>
					<p>You should file an income tax return to claim tax deductions for tax savings such as ELSS, PPF, NSC investments and for payments such as housing loan repayments, insurance premium and donations.</p>

					<h5>I receive my salary income after deduction of TDS. Am I required to file an income tax return?</h5>
					<p>You are required to file an income tax return once your annual income exceeds Rs 2.5 lakh. A deduction of TDS does not replace the requirement to file ITR. While e-filing your ITR, you should furnish the details of your annual income, claim deductions and credit for TDS deducted by your employer.</p>

					<h5>How do I check TDS details from my form 26AS?</h5>
					<p>You can check your Form 26AS from your e-filing login. Our E-filing software auto-populates the TDS details from your Form 26AS in your income tax return.</p>

					<h5>How can I claim an income tax refund?</h5>
					<p>You can claim an income tax refund by e-filing your income tax return. An e-filing enables you to claim credit for excess TDS paid and a tax refund.</p>

					<h5>Is my data filed secure with Vidhik Sevaen?</h5>
					<p>Vidhik Sevaen uses a 128 bit SSL encryption for transmission of data and enables complete data privacy. We  does not share its data with unaffiliated third parties.</p>

					<h5>How to e-verify my ITR?</h5>
					<p>You can e-verify your ITR within 120 days from the date of filing. You can e-verify using your net banking account or Aadhaar based OTP. A failure to e-verify your ITR can invalidate your ITR filing.</p>
